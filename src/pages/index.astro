                    The Elever system enables you, Learning & Development
                    organizations and trainers, to create learning games and
                    manage multiple motivators in one “Gamification Management
                    System”. The learning experiences you create are based on
                    the individual situation of your cohort. Micro learning
                    activities help them to build a healthy weekly habit. This

                    With the Elever App you can create mini games based on your
